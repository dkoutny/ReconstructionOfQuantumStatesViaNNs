# ReconstructionOfQuantumStatesViaNNs

This repository provides data and supplementary material to the paper Neural-network quantum state tomography, by Dominik Koutný, Libor Motka, Zdeněk Hradil, Jaroslav Řeháček and L. L. Sánchez-Soto.


Let us present here results and codes for reconstructiong the quantum states via neural networks (NN).

File figures.ipynb containg the codes to generates plots from data stored in the file data.zip

The file named training_of_DNNs.py contain the description of the training process of various NNs. 

You can play with the reconstruct_your_own_quantum_state.ipynb to reconstruct the quantum state in a 3, 5, 7 or 9 dimensional Hilbert space with a set measurement settings. Code also contain comparison of the NNs based methods with the linear inversion, the semi-definite program and the maximum-likelihood algorithm.
