# ReconstructionOfQuantumStatesViaNNs

Let us present here results and codes for reconstructiong the quantum states via neural networks (NN).

File figures.ipynb containg the codes to generates plots from data stored in the file data.zip

The file named training_of_DNNs.py contain the description of the training process of various NNs.
